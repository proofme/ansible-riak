riak-ansible
========

This role will setup Riak on a node. It will ***not*** build a cluster.  In order to build a cluster, use one of the example playbooks defined below.

## **NOTE!** Huge update coming on dev-2.x branches

Master deploys as explained below. It's really behind, which is why we're cleaning up our branching strategy. Stay tuned, [read up](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-riak-community/blob/master/config-mgmt-strategy.md) and get involved!

You can [read the full guidelines](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/community/bugs/) for bug reporting and code contributions on the Riak Docs. And **thank you!** Your contribution is incredible important to us.


Requirements
------------

Tested with PackageCloud install of Riak on CentOS 6 & 7 and Ubuntu Precise.

Role Variables
--------------

If you have trouble seeing the tables below, please [read the documentation on Github](https://github.com/basho/ansible-riak/blob/master/README.md).


**Pay close attention** to the following variables as they will tune, affect, and possible **make your system unusable**.  They are settings to tune the operating system and filesystem.

| Name           | Default Value | Description                        |
| -------------- | ------------- | -----------------------------------|
| riak_tune_disks | no | enables  disk tunings |
| riak_filesystem | ext4         | filesystem used on Riak's data volume |
| riak_mountpoint| /             | mountpoint where Riak data is installed
| riak_partition |  /dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root   | device/partition that holds mounted Riak data
| riak_physical_disks| [sda]     | A list of the physical disks that make up Riak's data volume|


For example, if you installed Riak onto a system with a single root partition, then riak_mountpoint would be "/".  If you had a dedicated volume for riak data, riak_mountpoint would be "/path/to/that/mounted/volume."  

riak_partition: is the device that the riak_mountpoint is/will be mounted to.  You can gather that by running: 

	df /var/lib/riak

 
 riak_physical_disks is a list of physical disks that make up the riak_partition.  It could be one, or could be many depending if you are using, RAID, LVM, etc.
 
 If you wish to avoid any of the tuning, just leave riak_tune_disks to its default value of no.
 


### All of the Variables


Variables listed with "OS Specific" and "Install specific" have values defined in `vars/<ansible_os_family>.yml`.

Playbooks
------------

There are some sample playbooks in the [examples/](https://github.com/basho/ansible-riak/tree/master/examples) directory as well as a typical hosts file.
Take a look at [setup_riak.yml](https://github.com/basho/ansible-riak/blob/master/examples/setup_riak.yml).

First we set the role to the riak_cluster group as defined in the inventory.  Then we call the [form_cluster.yml](https://github.com/basho/ansible-riak/blob/master/examples/form_cluster.yml) playbook to actually join the cluster.  The following happens:

* the Riak node name of the first node is established
* all nodes in the group join that node
* the last node performs a cluster plan, and cluster commit


	

Dependencies
------------
